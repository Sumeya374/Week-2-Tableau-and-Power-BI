# Week 2 Tableau and PowerBI
 In Week 2, I imported data into the Tableau system for analysis. I set up relationships in tableau and created an interactive dashboard. Additionally, I learnt about Power BI and its features and functions. I designed a report in Power BI Desktop and developed a Power BI Dashboard.
